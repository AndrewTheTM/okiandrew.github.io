# Survey Analysis: Second Things Second

This is the second group of steps that I would use with a survey.  Some of the
specifics are subject to change due to moving from a trip-based model to an
activity based model.

## 1: Identify Tripmaking Outliers

This involves looking at households where the number, duration, speed, mode,
and/or purpose of the trips are so far out of line that we should check closer
into them.  

## 2: Compare PHH, WHH, VHH, and Income to Population

Since a survey is used to feed a model that ultimately needs to cover the entire
populaton of a region, it is pretty important to ensure that the survey
adequately reflects the region's population.
